# Filler

Filler is a project for my Hive Helsinki studies. It is about creating an algorithm that competes against others in a simple game.

__Usage:__
```
./filler_vm -f <map> -p1 <player1> -p2 <player2>
```

My own player can be found as `bbehm.filler` at the root of the repo and opponent players can be found in the `players` folder - they can however be a big buggy.

Three sample maps can be found in the `maps` folder.
